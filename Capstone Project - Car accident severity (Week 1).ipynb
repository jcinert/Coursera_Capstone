We would like to identify the most in fluencing variables that cause the accident and the level of severity. We will use X as a set of inependent variables and Y as our dependent variable. Following standard data science steps we will:\n* Review data further look for correlations, trends, ...\n* Prepare data - transformation, filling missing data, cleaning the dataset and remove not relevant columns\n* Model the prediction using different algorithms and compare results.\n* Evaluate and conclude which factors may have more impact on the accidents"
